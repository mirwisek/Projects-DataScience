## Representing time series as images for enhanced model performance [Current Engagement]
During an internship I worked on research topic "Representing time series as images" for potential future use cases in point forcasting, anamoly detection and Generative AI.
I've also had the opportunity to contribute to the following projects:
- https://github.com/FlorentF9/DESOM
- https://github.com/FlorentF9/SOMperf

**I'm currently submitting my work for a publication on NeurIPS**

## [Emotion Classification on Tweets](https://github.com/mirwisek/emotion-classification-twitter)
This project compares the performance of LLMs (DistilBERT and BERTweet) to conventional models such as CNN in two tasks:
1. Classification of Emotions
2. Classification of Sentiments

## [Intruder Detection with OpenCV](https://github.com/mirwisek/intruder-detector)
An Android project that uses OpenCV Android to detect intruder in low-light conditions, taking the snapshots with flashlight, uploads it to the cloud and notifies the owner.

## üèÜ[AgriFarm - Google Android Developers Challenge Winner](https://github.com/mirwisek/AgriFarm) 
AgriFarm won best app of the year award in Google Android Developers Challenge for its innovative approach to detecting crop disease with on-device Machine Learning.

## [Touchless UI - Hand Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/mirwisek/avius) 
Uses offline machine learning to detect thumbs-up/thumbs-down gestures as an interactive approach to collect user feedback for surveys. Offered as an Android app.
