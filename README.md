# Data Science Projects

## [Mistral x Alan, Paris Hackathon](https://mistral.ai/news/2024-ft-hackathon/)
### [Swift Bird - Emergency Room Assistant Chatbot](https://github.com/mirwisek/disease-preselection-app)
Built **Swift Bird Chatbot** with RAG and prompt engineering on Mistral Large 2:
- Implemented voice mode with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text
- Added image comprehension with Pixtral
- Support for multiple languages üá¨üáß, üá´üá∑, and üá™üá∏.

## Representing time series as images for enhanced model performance
As part of my master research internship I worked on research topic **"Exploring Image Representations of Time-Series for Enhanced Model Performance"**. The significance of my work is in synthetic dataset generation for large-scale time-series data. 

I've also had the opportunity to contribute to the following projects:
- https://github.com/FlorentF9/DESOM
- https://github.com/FlorentF9/SOMperf

## [Emotion Classification on Tweets](https://github.com/mirwisek/emotion-classification-twitter)
This project compares the performance of LLMs (DistilBERT and BERTweet) to conventional models such as CNN in two tasks:
1. Classification of Emotions
2. Classification of Sentiments

## [Intruder Detection with OpenCV](https://github.com/mirwisek/intruder-detector)
An Android project that uses OpenCV Android to detect intruder in low-light conditions, taking the snapshots with flashlight, uploads it to the cloud and notifies the owner.

## üèÜ[AgriFarm - Google Android Developers Challenge Winner](https://github.com/mirwisek/AgriFarm) 
AgriFarm won best app of the year award in Google Android Developers Challenge for its innovative approach to detecting crop disease with on-device Machine Learning.

## [Touchless UI - Hand Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/mirwisek/avius) 
Uses offline machine learning to detect thumbs-up/thumbs-down gestures as an interactive approach to collect user feedback for surveys. Offered as an Android app.
