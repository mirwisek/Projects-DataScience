# Data Science Projects

## Generating Synthetic Time Series with Generative AI [Current Engagement]
I'm working on an innovative approach to generate highly utilizable synthtic timeseries from a given dataset. 

## [Emotion Classification on Tweets](https://github.com/mirwisek/emotion-classification-twitter)
This project compares the performance of LLMs (DistilBERT and BERTweet) to conventional models such as CNN in two tasks:
1. Classification of Emotions
2. Classification of Sentiments

## [Intruder Detection with OpenCV](https://github.com/mirwisek/intruder-detector)
An Android project that uses OpenCV Android to detect intruder in low-light conditions, taking the snapshots with flashlight, uploads it to the cloud and notifies the owner.

## üèÜ[AgriFarm - Google Android Developers Challenge Winner](https://github.com/mirwisek/AgriFarm) 
AgriFarm won best app of the year award in Google Android Developers Challenge for its innovative approach to detecting crop disease with on-device Machine Learning.

## [Touchless UI - Hand Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/mirwisek/avius) 
Uses offline machine learning to detect thumbs-up/thumbs-down gestures as an interactive approach to collect user feedback for surveys. Offered as an Android app.
